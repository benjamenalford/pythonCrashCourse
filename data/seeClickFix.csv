The street in front of my property was only surfaced to the mailbox.  My property extends to 18 inches past the privacy fence.  The crew told me that my property is in the middle of 44th Street Terrace and Misty Harbor so they were going to stop it at the mailbox.  NO, my entire property is, and always HAS been on Misty Harbor Ave.  I am NOT on 44th Street Terrace.  The crew told me that my address was 'pinging' on 44th Street Terrace and they were not going to surface the road past my mailbox.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  In front of my driveway, half is surfaced, the other half, unsurfaced.  I was told that all of Misty Harbor Avenue would be surfaced, which includes the entire frontage of my home.  Furthermore, my property and the street itself is 17 years' old, and has never been resurfaced.  It has been patched so many times it looks like a relief map of South America.  HOWEVER, the newer streets to the North, that are less than five years of age and are largely unoccupied/new construction, were resurfaced!!  I would think after paying 17 years' worth of SPECIALS that I could get an additional 25-30 feet of resurfacing done.  It absolutely looks ridiculous.  There are two houses to the East of my property that are on 44th Street Terrace that would also have to be resurfaced, as those properties and streets are the same age and were entirely skipped, as well.  The homes in this area are in the 260k range and this takes away from the neighborhood; plus the uneven pavement is a definite safety issue.  I am very concerned that the city believes my property is half on Misty Harbor Ave., and half on 44th Street Terrace - because I guess if the city decides to resurface 44th Street Terrace, they won't surface Misty Harbor Avenue??  That's ridiculous, as well.  Please respond and please come back and finish this job, because it is ugly, and needs review.  Lastly, I did call the Engineering department yesterday and left a message for a Mr. Foust or Faust - of course, no call back.

Why not put up some concrete barricades to block traffic on the 3 access roads to those hills, so only bike and foot traffic are allowed?  If someone needs to see the property, they can just drive around the blockade, but it will stop a good number of the folks racing and dumping all kinds of crazy stuff in the area.  If someone builds up there, then the barricades can be removed, but there is no need for the traffic in what is laughingly known by the local kids as the ""420 Hills"".

So far that had been working, but this morning the rain came too fast, and the river channel forced the storm water back through our downspout toward the house, so we had to re-route the gutter and bail for hours to keep the house from flooding again.  We will try to fix it, but there is only a 5 foot strip beside our house to work with, so we're pretty limited.

My house is almost middle of the block. When repairing the alley it was graded level. There should be a 2 to 3 degree incline from center of alley to the ends of the alley for proper water drainage. As you can see from the photos attached, this is not the case. When graded they also created a curb of sorts against my gravel area to my garage. This caused my graveled area to also not drain away from my garage to the alley. Instead all water backed up in middle of the alley and my graveled area causing my garage to flood. I had to build up gravel from my area as a sort of dam to keep so much water from coming in to the garage. This has not been an issue until the alleyway way repaired recently. I am not concerned with the garage as I have gotten it dried out, but would like the alleyway repaired probably to allow for proper water drainage. Also would like to mention there is a sidewalk at the south end of the alley that the gravel has just been graded over. This sidewalk now sits 2 to 3 inches below gravel.

With the few upgrades I have seen from the ground there has been one thing that has bothered me for some time which the city keeps ignoring.  Your lighting issues.  Even though it may not be required for the height it is common courtesy in many cities that all municipal water storage tanks be properly lit with FAA approved lighting regardless if the tower is in line of airspace travel in that area of town. This tower for some time has not had a very well lit light if working at all especially recently since they did minor repairs late last year when they added the new tank access on the top of the storage tank.  I would hope you are going to invest in a new improved light, a LED/strobe version similar to what the VA hospital went with on the top of their tower a few years ago. No maintenance, no bulbs to change.  It's money well spent.  I also noticed you had someone raise your lighting on your Montara area water tower a while back to clear over all the obstacles that have been added to that one. Great job. Only issue is you have the same issue on your water tower behind the Soldier Township Fire Department. That light fixture also needs raised and or upgraded. With LED fixtures taking place of the older incandescent bulbs you should probably budget to upgrade all the lighting on your towers over time. As far as the one behind Soldier Township Fire Department you can't see that light working well at night because it's being blocked by all the clutter that's been added.

Furthermore, my property and the street itself is 17 years' old, and has never been resurfaced.  It has been patched so many times it looks like a relief map of South America.

If someone needs to see the property, they can just drive around the blockade, but it will stop a good number of the folks racing and dumping all kinds of crazy stuff in the area.

The owner said it had flooded once, and been repaired, but obviously lied.  It is the oldest house in the neighborhood; at least 3 of the surrounding houses, which were built up higher, have storm water drains flowing toward our back yard.  We moved back out and hired a firm to rip out the carpet and trim boards, and dry everything out last summer. Then we built a French drain and a berm, to divert the water around our property.  So far that had been working, but this morning the rain came too fast, and the river channel forced the storm water back through our downspout toward the house, so we had to re-route the gutter and bail for hours to keep the house from flooding again.  We will try to fix it, but there is only a 5 foot strip beside our house to work with, so we're pretty limited.  In addition, one of the workers we've hired thinks our water bill will be raised because we are diverting so much storm water into the front sewer, even though the water is not coming from our lot.

My house is almost middle of the block. When repairing the alley it was graded level. There should be a 2 to 3 degree incline from center of alley to the ends of the alley for proper water drainage. As you can see from the photos attached, this is not the case. When graded they also created a curb of sorts against my gravel area to my garage. This caused my graveled area to also not drain away from my garage to the alley. Instead all water backed up in middle of the alley and my graveled area causing my garage to flood. I had to build up gravel from my area as a sort of dam to keep so much water from coming in to the garage. This has not been an issue until the alleyway way repaired recently. I am not concerned with the garage as I have gotten it dried out, but would like the alleyway repaired probably to allow for proper water drainage. Also would like to mention there is a sidewalk at the south end of the alley that the gravel has just been graded over. This sidewalk now sits 2 to 3 inches below gravel.

A curb is a traffic control device and should not be the depth of a hole in the middle of a road. The downspouts from the hotel continually have water coming out of them which I assume is either due to condensation on the roof but may also be condensers from the mechanical units. Whether it has rained or not, this alley is continually ponding and gross. Many people park in this area and travel this alley to get to their building for the capitol.

With the few upgrades I have seen from the ground there has been one thing that has bothered me for some time which the city keeps ignoring.  Your lighting issues.  Even though it may not be required for the height it is common courtesy in many cities that all municipal water storage tanks be properly lit with FAA approved lighting regardless if the tower is in line of airspace travel in that area of town. This tower for some time has not had a very well lit light if working at all especially recently since they did minor repairs late last year when they added the new tank access on the top of the storage tank.  I would hope you are going to invest in a new improved light, a LED/strobe version similar to what the VA hospital went with on the top of their tower a few years ago. No maintenance, no bulbs to change.  It's money well spent.  I also noticed you had someone raise your lighting on your Montara area water tower a while back to clear over all the obstacles that have been added to that one. Great job. Only issue is you have the same issue on your water tower behind the Soldier Township Fire Department. That light fixture also needs raised and or upgraded. With LED fixtures taking place of the older incandescent bulbs you should probably budget to upgrade all the lighting on your towers over time. As far as the one behind Soldier Township Fire Department you can't see that light working well at night because it's being blocked by all the clutter that's been added.

9112870,"Archived","Police General Issue","On Dec. 26th, 2020, I contacted TPD because a neighbor who has a history of harassing me had come onto my property (past a no trespassing sign) and threatened me with a tree branch.  I was at the extreme west end of my driveway, working on insulating my chicken coop, when he walked up to me and began shouting about tree branches--which he routinely throws onto my property, preventing my vehicles from accessing the street or the west side of the driveway for parking.  That day the neighbor assaulted me verbally and physically, yet Officer D. Long, who responded, handcuffed me, placing my hands behind my back in a very uncomfortable position and fastened so tightly that I was left with bruising up and down my wrist and hand.  A video of this bruising is available through Dropbox.
Officer Long was made aware, as he was handcuffing me, that I have breast cancer and that he was being too rough, pulling at my car keys snagged over one finger and buising my other hand as a result.  The officer did not relent, but placed me in his cruiser and forced me to sit with hands cuffed behind me until the supervising officer, Officer Rose, showed up.  At that point, my hands were repositioned in front and the cuffs loosened before--at Officer Rose's insistance--I was cited and released.
The offending neighbor was simply cited for criminal trespass (though not assault, as far as I know)--he was not handcuffed and not forced to sit in a police car for half an hour on a holiday.  This persistant and inconsistent enforcement of the law has now created a record of my neighbor's harrassing behaviors toward me, the TPD practice of ignoring my evidence and statements about these incidents, and of Officer D. Long's refusal to correctly address me, using my title, Dr. Fritzler.
I believe Officer D. Long was unnecessarily rough in handcuffing me, showed hugely favored treatment to the accused--my neighbor, a Washburn law graduate, who regularly surveils my backyard with video cameras and spotlights, and antagonizes me on a near daily basis.  I further believe Officer Long's manner in taking reports, when he responds to my 911 calls, is disrespectful, rude and abusive.  When he is wrong, he refuses to acknowledge that fact and merely compounds the error with his continued selective application of the law.
The neighbor in previous weeks (on Dec. 1st) had followed me into the street, when I was looking for a missing cat, and shoved me three times--assaulting me.  Again, when I called TPD, Officer Ziegler responded and refused to cite the suspect/neighbor simply because the neighbor, when asked, denied having assaulted me or, presumably, having followed me into the street.
If the city needs a witness, though he would be hostile, another neighbor
came out into the street that evening when I positioned myself near his barking dogs in hopes the first neighbor (Mark (last name?) would leave me alone.  The second neighbor was extremely hostile about my being near his dogs and threatened to hit me while his mother yelled obscenities from their backdoor at 19th and SW Buchanan.  (!)
There seems to be grossly preferential and selective applications of laws regarding assault when TPD officers are called.  I was told by TPD officers on Dec. 27th, that what results an assault complaint brings are purely a matter of which officer responds.  This is not acceptable.  Further, when someone trespasses onto my property, I should be able to protect myself when they assault me--whether that is verbally, physically or both.

The street in front of my property was only surfaced to the mailbox.  My property extends to 18 inches past the privacy fence.  The crew told me that my property is in the middle of 44th Street Terrace and Misty Harbor so they were going to stop it at the mailbox.

In front of my driveway, half is surfaced, the other half, unsurfaced.  I was told that all of Misty Harbor Avenue would be surfaced, which includes the entire frontage of my home.  Furthermore, my property and the street itself is 17 years' old, and has never been resurfaced.  It has been patched so many times it looks like a relief map of South America.  HOWEVER, the newer streets to the North, that are less than five years of age and are largely unoccupied/new construction, were resurfaced!!  I would think after paying 17 years' worth of SPECIALS that I could get an additional 25-30 feet of resurfacing done.  It absolutely looks ridiculous.  There are two houses to the East of my property that are on 44th Street Terrace that would also have to be resurfaced, as those properties and streets are the same age and were entirely skipped, as well.  The homes in this area are in the 260k range and this takes away from the neighborhood; plus the uneven pavement is a definite safety issue.  I am very concerned that the city believes my property is half on Misty Harbor Ave., and half on 44th Street Terrace - because I guess if the city decides to resurface 44th Street Terrace, they won't surface Misty Harbor Avenue??

9112870,"Archived","Police General Issue","On Dec. 26th, 2020, I contacted TPD because a neighbor who has a history of harassing me had come onto my property (past a no trespassing sign) and threatened me with a tree branch.  I was at the extreme west end of my driveway, working on insulating my chicken coop, when he walked up to me and began shouting about tree branches--which he routinely throws onto my property, preventing my vehicles from accessing the street or the west side of the driveway for parking.  That day the neighbor assaulted me verbally and physically, yet Officer D. Long, who responded, handcuffed me, placing my hands behind my back in a very uncomfortable position and fastened so tightly that I was left with bruising up and down my wrist and hand.  A video of this bruising is available through Dropbox.
Officer Long was made aware, as he was handcuffing me, that I have breast cancer and that he was being too rough, pulling at my car keys snagged over one finger and buising my other hand as a result.  The officer did not relent, but placed me in his cruiser and forced me to sit with hands cuffed behind me until the supervising officer, Officer Rose, showed up.  At that point, my hands were repositioned in front and the cuffs loosened before--at Officer Rose's insistance--I was cited and released.
The offending neighbor was simply cited for criminal trespass (though not assault, as far as I know)--he was not handcuffed and not forced to sit in a police car for half an hour on a holiday.  This persistant and inconsistent enforcement of the law has now created a record of my neighbor's harrassing behaviors toward me, the TPD practice of ignoring my evidence and statements about these incidents, and of Officer D. Long's refusal to correctly address me, using my title, Dr. Fritzler.
I believe Officer D. Long was unnecessarily rough in handcuffing me, showed hugely favored treatment to the accused--my neighbor, a Washburn law graduate, who regularly surveils my backyard with video cameras and spotlights, and antagonizes me on a near daily basis.  I further believe Officer Long's manner in taking reports, when he responds to my 911 calls, is disrespectful, rude and abusive.  When he is wrong, he refuses to acknowledge that fact and merely compounds the error with his continued selective application of the law.
The neighbor in previous weeks (on Dec. 1st) had followed me into the street, when I was looking for a missing cat, and shoved me three times--assaulting me.  Again, when I called TPD, Officer Ziegler responded and refused to cite the suspect/neighbor simply because the neighbor, when asked, denied having assaulted me or, presumably, having followed me into the street.
If the city needs a witness, though he would be hostile, another neighbor
came out into the street that evening when I positioned myself near his barking dogs in hopes the first neighbor (Mark (last name?) would leave me alone.  The second neighbor was extremely hostile about my being near his dogs and threatened to hit me while his mother yelled obscenities from their backdoor at 19th and SW Buchanan.  (!)
There seems to be grossly preferential and selective applications of laws regarding assault when TPD officers are called.  I was told by TPD officers on Dec. 27th, that what results an assault complaint brings are purely a matter of which officer responds.  This is not acceptable.  Further, when someone trespasses onto my property, I should be able to protect myself when they assault me--whether that is verbally, physically or both.

The street in front of my property was only surfaced to the mailbox.  My property extends to 18 inches past the privacy fence.  The crew told me that my property is in the middle of 44th Street Terrace and Misty Harbor so they were going to stop it at the mailbox.  NO, my entire property is, and always HAS been on Misty Harbor Ave.  I am NOT on 44th Street Terrace.  The crew told me that my address was 'pinging' on 44th Street Terrace and they were not going to surface the road past my mailbox.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  In front of my driveway, half is surfaced, the other half, unsurfaced.  I was told that all of Misty Harbor Avenue would be surfaced, which includes the entire frontage of my home.  Furthermore, my property and the street itself is 17 years' old, and has never been resurfaced.  It has been patched so many times it looks like a relief map of South America.  HOWEVER, the newer streets to the North, that are less than five years of age and are largely unoccupied/new construction, were resurfaced!!  I would think after paying 17 years' worth of SPECIALS that I could get an additional 25-30 feet of resurfacing done.  It absolutely looks ridiculous.  There are two houses to the East of my property that are on 44th Street Terrace that would also have to be resurfaced, as those properties and streets are the same age and were entirely skipped, as well.  The homes in this area are in the 260k range and this takes away from the neighborhood; plus the uneven pavement is a definite safety issue.  I am very concerned that the city believes my property is half on Misty Harbor Ave., and half on 44th Street Terrace - because I guess if the city decides to resurface 44th Street Terrace, they won't surface Misty Harbor Avenue??

Why not put up some concrete barricades to block traffic on the 3 access roads to those hills, so only bike and foot traffic are allowed?  If someone needs to see the property, they can just drive around the blockade, but it will stop a good number of the folks racing and dumping all kinds of crazy stuff in the area.  If someone builds up there, then the barricades can be removed, but there is no need for the traffic in what is laughingly known by the local kids as the ""420 Hills"".

7876652,"Archived","Too much stormwater","We bought this house in May 2019, and it began flooding shortly after we moved in. The owner said it had flooded once, and been repaired, but obviously lied.  It is the oldest house in the neighborhood; at least 3 of the surrounding houses, which were built up higher, have storm water drains flowing toward our back yard.  We moved back out and hired a firm to rip out the carpet and trim boards, and dry everything out last summer. Then we built a French drain and a berm, to divert the water around our property.  So far that had been working, but this morning the rain came too fast, and the river channel forced the storm water back through our downspout toward the house, so we had to re-route the gutter and bail for hours to keep the house from flooding again.  We will try to fix it, but there is only a 5 foot strip beside our house to work with, so we're pretty limited.  In addition, one of the workers we've hired thinks our water bill will be raised because we are diverting so much storm water into the front sewer, even though the water is not coming from our lot.  Could someone please come to look at this in person?",39.013839,-95.61080699999999,"2930 Se Walnut Dr Topeka, KS, 66605, USA","2020-05-26T14:18:20-04:00","2020-05-26T14:18:49-04:00","2020-06-02T15:13:59-04:00","https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/7876652"

My house is almost middle of the block. When repairing the alley it was graded level. There should be a 2 to 3 degree incline from center of alley to the ends of the alley for proper water drainage. As you can see from the photos attached, this is not the case. When graded they also created a curb of sorts against my gravel area to my garage. This caused my graveled area to also not drain away from my garage to the alley. Instead all water backed up in middle of the alley and my graveled area causing my garage to flood. I had to build up gravel from my area as a sort of dam to keep so much water from coming in to the garage. This has not been an issue until the alleyway way repaired recently. I am not concerned with the garage as I have gotten it dried out, but would like the alleyway repaired probably to allow for proper water drainage. Also would like to mention there is a sidewalk at the south end of the alley that the gravel has just been graded over. This sidewalk now sits 2 to 3 inches below gravel.

6103634,"Archived","General Feedback or Questions","Noticed your water tower at 29th & California is now getting long overdue repairs.  With the few upgrades I have seen from the ground there has been one thing that has bothered me for some time which the city keeps ignoring.  Your lighting issues.  Even though it may not be required for the height it is common courtesy in many cities that all municipal water storage tanks be properly lit with FAA approved lighting regardless if the tower is in line of airspace travel in that area of town. This tower for some time has not had a very well lit light if working at all especially recently since they did minor repairs late last year when they added the new tank access on the top of the storage tank.  I would hope you are going to invest in a new improved light, a LED/strobe version similar to what the VA hospital went with on the top of their tower a few years ago. No maintenance, no bulbs to change.  It's money well spent.  I also noticed you had someone raise your lighting on your Montara area water tower a while back to clear over all the obstacles that have been added to that one. Great job. Only issue is you have the same issue on your water tower behind the Soldier Township Fire Department. That light fixture also needs raised and or upgraded. With LED fixtures taking place of the older incandescent bulbs you should probably budget to upgrade all the lighting on your towers over time. As far as the one behind Soldier Township Fire Department you can't see that light working well at night because it's being blocked by all the clutter that's been added.  If Forbes Field and the V.A. takes lighting that seriously so should the city.  I hope you will seriously look into these issues....",39.0151999020465,-95.6525720745524,"1930 Se 29th St Topeka, KS, 66605, USA","2019-06-27T23:24:44-04:00","2019-06-27T23:25:09-04:00","2019-07-01T12:12:14-04:00","https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/6103634"

I have gone there often for the last 6 years and my dog is very reactive to smoke. We usually go to the Lawrence dog park now which is tobacco-free because whenever we are in the Topeka dog park it seems like people are just not mindful of their cigarette smoke their cigarette butts and there is constantly the ashtray being knocked over. Today we were only there for a couple minutes before somebody inhales their cigarettes and looks down at my dog and blow the smoke directly in her face, I am just wondering if there is anything that can be done about this issue. The dog park is not really a place to be smoking cigars as is often done in the evenings but I feel that the dog park would be a much safer place for pets if the owners had a designated spot outside to go to versus just smoking everywhere in the park and properly disposing of their cigarette buds not just tossing them where are animals play. I know many dog parks have been going smoke-free and I was wondering if Topeka is going to follow that trend",39.0535097134114,-95.7278600335121,"850-898 Sw Zoo Pkwy Topeka, KS, 66604, USA","2020-07-07T21:36:59-04:00","2020-07-07T21:37:14-04:00","2020-07-20T14:16:56-04:00","https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/8145598"

The portion of the tree connected to this limb is hanging low to the ground and is an obstacle for cars driving down 7th. We thought we'd try to trim it but are now thinking it's more of a project than we can take on ourselves. The tree has not been looking the healthiest on the trunk and bark for some time now. If you decide that it needs to leave completely, that's fine with us. If you think trimming it will take care of the issue, that's fine too. We are concerned the entire limb is going to snap off on the next windy day. It's getting lower and more split each day. The tree is located on the south side of 7th Ave between Jewell and the alley located mid-block between Jewell and College. It is situated between 2 large pin oak trees. Thanks.

Two potholes still exist and were not filled at the intersection of Gage and 8th street. (1) One pothole is at the beginning of 8th street and is in the mid center portion of 8th street immediately E of Gage.  (2) The second hole is on the N, next  to hole #1.  (They are side by side). They both may have some sand in them.  (3) Going E up 8th about 1 small block on the right side is a hole off an alley that leads directly into 8th street.

The alley, which is between Hampton and 21st street, behind our house, is badly in need of grading
when you have the time.  We have some pretty big holes that need filled.
I also have a special request to ask and I’m Not sure you can do it, but the bushes on either side
of the alley are basically growing together toward the middle of the alley road.
There are an abundance of rental houses on 21st & Washburn, and on our street of Lane,
so no one takes care of them.    It’s only about half of the alley where the rentals are that
the bushes are in need of being cut back.
I appreciate any help you can give us!

Vehicles do not realize half the time the water over the roadway until too late.

I have added small rock over time but that gets washed away with rain as well.

I know the police can't be everywhere, and they have better things to do than to protect some vacant lots, but I had a suggestion I took to our HOA, and they suggested I contacted the city.  Why not put up some concrete barricades to block traffic on the 3 access roads to those hills, so only bike and foot traffic are allowed?  If someone needs to see the property, they can just drive around the blockade, but it will stop a good number of the folks racing and dumping all kinds of crazy stuff in the area.  If someone builds up there, then the barricades can be removed, but there is no need for the traffic in what is laughingly known by the local kids as the ""420 Hills"".

The owner said it had flooded once, and been repaired, but obviously lied.  It is the oldest house in the neighborhood; at least 3 of the surrounding houses, which were built up higher, have storm water drains flowing toward our back yard.  We moved back out and hired a firm to rip out the carpet and trim boards, and dry everything out last summer. Then we built a French drain and a berm, to divert the water around our property.  So far that had been working, but this morning the rain came too fast, and the river channel forced the storm water back through our downspout toward the house, so we had to re-route the gutter and bail for hours to keep the house from flooding again.  We will try to fix it, but there is only a 5 foot strip beside our house to work with, so we're pretty limited.  In addition, one of the workers we've hired thinks our water bill will be raised because we are diverting so much storm water into the front sewer, even though the water is not coming from our lot.

My house is almost middle of the block. When repairing the alley it was graded level. There should be a 2 to 3 degree incline from center of alley to the ends of the alley for proper water drainage. As you can see from the photos attached, this is not the case. When graded they also created a curb of sorts against my gravel area to my garage. This caused my graveled area to also not drain away from my garage to the alley. Instead all water backed up in middle of the alley and my graveled area causing my garage to flood. I had to build up gravel from my area as a sort of dam to keep so much water from coming in to the garage. This has not been an issue until the alleyway way repaired recently. I am not concerned with the garage as I have gotten it dried out, but would like the alleyway repaired probably to allow for proper water drainage. Also would like to mention there is a sidewalk at the south end of the alley that the gravel has just been graded over. This sidewalk now sits 2 to 3 inches below gravel.

Last year a company was out to repaint this water tower, and everything but the tank looks descent as far as quality of work done.  Looks as if they hardly put a coat on the tank.

The easement is behind my house at 3231 plass avenue.  if someone could contact me about this we would appreicate it.

We took a bike ride to Lake Shawnee, (we live in the 30th & Burlingame area). We took 37th street most of the way and used the bike lane.  When we returned, my wife had a flat tire, actually the tire was cut and not repairable.  On our ride we noticed the bike lanes had a lot of debris in them, glass, rocks, tree limbs, etc. This debris was obviously the cause of the flat tire.  If you want cyclists to use the bike lanes it is going to be imperative the city keep them clean.  Another issue is bike lanes and parking being used in the same space.  This occurs on Lane St. and Washburn Ave. This creates a dangerous situation for cyclists because it gives the cyclist a feeling of safety until they encounter a parked vehicle in their path.

My grandparents’ dog was hit and killed by a speeding driver this evening. We did call the police and they advised they unfortunately weren’t able to do anything about the dog, but said that they would increase patrol in the area, and the Sgt we talked to strongly suggested we contact the city engineer to request speed bumps on Westview.

Would this initiate that? Or could you tell me the proper channels to get this started? I have lived here since 2004 and it has always been an issue. I have three kids that we won’t allow to play out front - at all - because of the speed on this street.

Please let me know if speed bumps are a possibility. I truly think they would help tremendously.

I am at a loss to your response.  As a citizen I expect the laws of our city to be enforced when they are pointed out to our police department.  This car may not seem like it is bothering anything to the officer who only stops by for a brief minute but is does affect the quality of life for the neighbors in the area.  The car has not moved for over 6 months and there are even weeds starting to grow around the car.  Our city code clearly state a car cannot sit in one place for more than 48 hours.  This car has sat in the same location for an access of 4300 hours.  I am sure this vehicle fits the intent of the code.  I am not asking for a ticket I am asking that the police department take action and see that this car is moved and in compliance with our city code.  I have attached the code in case you are not aware of what you are expected to enforce.   In addition if that car is not registered to anyone at that house or someone nearby then I would think it would be considered abandoned having more of a reason to remove it.

It shall be unlawful for any person to park or permit the parking, storing or standing of any vehicle upon any public street or street parking in the city for any continuous period of more than 48 hours. Any motor vehicle which shall have been found to have remained parked, stored or located upon any of the public streets or parkings of the city for a continuous period of more than 48 hours shall be deemed a public nuisance and such nuisance may be abated in the manner provided in this article.

Each time it's patched, the water just flows in a different section, further decaying the asphalt which is no longer stable.  There are now three holes which are deeper than a 4"" curb. A curb is a traffic control device and should not be the depth of a hole in the middle of a road. The downspouts from the hotel continually have water coming out of them which I assume is either due to condensation on the roof but may also be condensers from the mechanical units. Whether it has rained or not, this alley is continually ponding and gross. Many people park in this area and travel this alley to get to their building for the capitol. This situation is going to be worse and unsafe this winter when these continual ponds turn to ice. I hope this can properly be repaired before there is an accident.

As was the main reason for the complaint last year, it’s been miserable for us to have any outdoor activities, whether for or children, or for family.

As well as this, there is also the garbage strewn throughout the back yard, and the vehicle parked in the alley.  Not only are the tags expired, but this thing has not moved in over a year.

One simply can’t ask these people to take care of these issues, so I’m turning over for help, once again.

Every time I get it stopped, it starts back up some time in the future. I've gone round & round with Waste Management, Deffenbaugh, and Ditch. Some of their drivers were dumping at 2 and 3 o'clock at night. I've called the companies, the police, and the city council. But it always returns right back to the same problem. Recently some @#$% from Waste Management has been dumping two dumpsters for Grace Liquor store every Monday morning at 5:00 in the morning. I called Waste Management two weeks ago and politely ask them to knock it off. The clown I talked to tried telling me the noise ordinance doesn't apply to their trucks picking up commercial dumpsters. I told him he was wrong that the noise ordinance explicitly states ""the loading & unloading of trucks"". Well, they were back this morning at 5:00 waking up the whole neighborhood. Could you please make them quit at let them know the ordinance is from 11pm to 7am?

6103634,"Archived","General Feedback or Questions","Noticed your water tower at 29th & California is now getting long overdue repairs.  With the few upgrades I have seen from the ground there has been one thing that has bothered me for some time which the city keeps ignoring.  Your lighting issues.  Even though it may not be required for the height it is common courtesy in many cities that all municipal water storage tanks be properly lit with FAA approved lighting regardless if the tower is in line of airspace travel in that area of town. This tower for some time has not had a very well lit light if working at all especially recently since they did minor repairs late last year when they added the new tank access on the top of the storage tank.  I would hope you are going to invest in a new improved light, a LED/strobe version similar to what the VA hospital went with on the top of their tower a few years ago. No maintenance, no bulbs to change.  It's money well spent.  I also noticed you had someone raise your lighting on your Montara area water tower a while back to clear over all the obstacles that have been added to that one. Great job. Only issue is you have the same issue on your water tower behind the Soldier Township Fire Department. That light fixture also needs raised and or upgraded. With LED fixtures taking place of the older incandescent bulbs you should probably budget to upgrade all the lighting on your towers over time.

Even when the water finally receded there is dirt/mud covering the sidewalk.  The houses that back up to this are along Amhurst Road.  Someone needs to (1) clean off the mud and (2) regrade the area to allow water to drain.  While the water and mud is an inconvienince to some, people in wheel chairs cannot go through this.

Two doors east, their dogs have been loose for three days. Yesterday and today they've been in my back yard and I can't let my own dog out. My dog is blind and a sudden, curious dog coming up to mine in our yard is asking for issues. I yelled at the dogs to get out just now and it charged me up to my door.

I have reported these dogs many times. Animal Control knows the dogs. So has the neighbor in between our houses. They charge us or seem like they are, bark at us and don't seem just to be playing. They are pit bulls. I don't care what breed they are but I don't want to wait for Topeka to do something only after one of the neighbors are injured.
